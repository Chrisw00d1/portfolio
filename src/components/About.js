        <h2>Chris Wood</h2>
        <p>I graduated in 2020 with BEng (Hons) first class degree of Mechanical Engineering from the University of Swansea.
          Throughout the course I was exposed to programming which ranged from analysing data to getting a robot arm to mimic my arm movement.
          The designing and building process in coding sparked the same interest with the design process I got from my engineering course. <br></br><br></br>
          Once I finished University I decided to pursue this new interest I had in coding as I did not need to be in a dedicated workshop to be able to work on projects. I joined a remote software engineering immersive course with General Assembly which covers the fundamentals of Web Development with the aim of being able to apply the skills I learnt from the course into a Software Engineering role.</p>
